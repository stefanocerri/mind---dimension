    "description": "Kerri 'Kaos' Chandler dropping some neat early 90's House pressure on the mighty Strictly Rhythm under his KCYC pseudonym. That's right, more and more gems mined deep outta the SR archives! 'I'm Not Dreaming / Side By Side' both serve up that typical, cherished KC vibe, all chunky swinging drums and deep basslines, and not forgetting those chords, with Chevelle's vox taking us into the garage stratosphere. The b-side is a more introspective affair, but nonetheless pure dancefloor fire. You cannot put a foot wrong with Kerri during this period, this one ticks all the boxes and has been given some tasty 2019 remastering treatment and repressed onto a high quality, weighty 12\" for all you record lovers out there, this one will keep them moving in the mix. Perfect NYC/NJ House sounds here, untouched and represented in it's original 1993 form with original Strictly label artwork, snoozing not permitted!"

As a long-time label collaborator and friend, it’s no surprise that Curtis delivers his 5th and 6th EP for the label. Total Art Of Living contains straight up house jams, hints of techno, nods to broken beat, references to Detroit and a few interludes for good measure. These new cuts are further proof that Iron Curtis music has always celebrated the deepest foundations of house and all its varieties, whilst resolutely refusing to get nostalgic. Curtis’ previous 4 Hudd EPs have gone on to be classics, Total Art Of Living has all the ingredients to become a future classic too."

Taken from the forthcoming EP of the same name, ‘Breathe’ showcases Joseph Ashworth’s emotive, atmospheric brand of electronica. Featuring the delicate vocals of Vanity Fairy, no fewer than three versions of the track feature on the hotly anticipated EP, as well as further tracks ‘Alternator’ and ‘Expectation’. 2019 was a year where Joseph Ashworth’s music took a turn to the left-field, combining a darker edge and catching the attention of DJ Tennis, who signed his ‘Trooper’ EP to the Life & Death imprint. A stand-out release championed by the likes of Sven Vath and Adriatique, it has come to cement his position as a unique talent at the top of his game."

Twelve tracks form the backbone to this wide-spanning sonic journey that document the highs and lows of this time. Drawn out of their comfort zone, it's safe to say this shift in their creative paradigm resonates throughout 'Moments'. Inviting you to gaze deeper inside, the album floats in a haze of dreaminess and cottony serenity. Though seemingly simple, the track titles point at themes more complex and universal that will strike a chord with every soul."

Although my roots are firmly in Breakbeat-Rave, I was also captivated by the big room sound of labels like R&S, Guerilla, Hard Hands and Sven Väth’s Harthouse from that same period of time. My studio is full of old equipment that fuelled that original European sound so I quickly found myself focussing on a bunch of tracks that are heavily influenced by some really special music that often gets forgotten.\" SC"

    "description": "Metal is a collaborative endeavor between Bristol and London artists Jamie Paton and Mike Bourne of Cage & Aviary and Teeth Of The Sea, respectively. A shared love for modular synthesis brought the two together in 2018 for a series of improvised live performances and the tracks featured on this EP were born from rehearsals for those sessions. What draws ESP to this music is its paradigmatic nature. The tracks are exercises in improvisation yet there is a level of control in which the performance slowly comes alive. Jam sessions allow for artistic gratification, a freedom of form often at the expense of the listener, but when artists set forth exacting parameters, there grows an opportunity for alternate forms of fulfillment on both sides of the experience. As is typical among stylistic prototypes, a reduction of tools frees the artist to narrow their focus and explore more singular modes of performance. Jamie and Mike chose texture as a concept, namely Metal, and following the aforementioned methods, minimized their instrumentation toward the aesthetic representation of that element. Operating in a void without the convenience and advantages of the infinite tools we’re now accustomed to, they exhausted a short list of granular details, honing their concept to a fine point. Throughout these three iterations on the theme, we hear timbres that depict metal literally, but moreover we gain a view into the duo’s visceral attachment to its materiality, abstractions of its surfaces, and an overall transgression from conventional constructs of beauty. The idea is simple, designed with discipline to romanticize both the crudeness and elegance in one of Earth’s most industrious and enigmatic elements. Metal."

Released in 1979 in the vein of Cerrone and Giorgio Moroder, ‘Hills of Katmandu’ is a unique, progressive slice of classic Italo Disco. The pulsating ‘Moroder-on-steroids bassline’, menacing female vocal and warbling synths take you on a trippy disco journey. The track became a huge dancefloor anthem at legendary clubs such as The Loft and The Saint in New York and Baia Degli Angeli in Rimini."

Having made music since his early teens and now in his early twenties, this 10,000 hours honing in on self-education and exploration has resulted in a keen ability to be meticulous in his output. ‘Fade’ is an almost suppressed UKG, chord progressions running in the opposite direction of is elder cousin’s dancefloor swagger, right out the door and on the night bus home. Slipstream works to exemplify the attention to detail Max has managed to work into his productions, successfully unifying anxious percussion carried with cloud-like ambience."
