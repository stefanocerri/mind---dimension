On the flip side ‘People like This’ is a slightly deeper diversion championed by a beautiful 303 bass arpeggiator motif, voice vocoder, subtle delayed bells, and immersive atmospheres transporting you into LVCA’s hypnotic sound. Closing out the EP is ‘Timeless Melody,' deep, elegant and sublime with touches of beautiful piano riffs, warm chords, seductive voices; ready to mesmerise and be dropped at sunrise, sunset or whenever you please.",

    "description": "Rebuke returns to Drumcode with a trio of timeless dancefloor weapons.<br>\nThe Irishman’s ‘Rattle’ was a standout of 2019, judged by DJ Mag as their no.22 top track of the year and is etched in the Drumcode discography as one of the most original releases to date. A valued part of Adam Beyer’s extended collective; he would have made his Drumcode event debut at WMC in Miami this March. Without a doubt, a sophomore EP was always on the cards.<br>\n <br>\n‘Instatik’ kicks the work into gear, a rugged, reverb-heavy cut with industrial drums that pump like pistons and an undulating synth effect that makes you feel like you’re on a turbo-charged rollercoaster. ‘Livewire’ has the trademark Rebuke brain-scrambling stamp on it, a flurry of steelyard percussion bring the track to life, before a low-end melody swells to attention, rubbing shoulders deliciously with driving drumlines, for an uplifting second half. The title track ‘Obscurity’ is a dark slice of techno funk, filled with synapse-tickling arpeggios, before a rollicking groove takes hold and launches the track home at full-flight. Another thrilling and innovative release to add to the Rebuke canon.<br>\n <br>\n“I think 2020 will go down in history as the craziest year of our lifetime. The future is still pretty unknown right now and things are drastically changing week to week. With that in mind, I felt ‘Obscurity’ would be a fitting title for my second Drumcode EP. It represents the state of being unknown, unclear or difficult to understand – feelings I’m sure most of us are going through right now. Most the tracks aside from ‘Livewire’ were written in quarantine; ‘Livewire’ was written right before the virus shut the world down, in a hotel room in Lima, Peru in January. This EP is my favourite to date as I think it shows a different side to my musical palette, whilst still developing the signature sound heard in all my music.” – Rebuke",

    "description": "'Music For Us' is Italo-Disco in its pure state! If the two original versions on this 12inch reissue's main side by House of Music are \"untouchables\" as the \"purists\" rightly claim, the rebuilt version by Danilo Braca on the flip must also be considered a masterpiece! The original vocal is hot, Helene has a very sexy voice, while the instrumental has a strong groove, thanks to the excellent synthesizers and bass. It seems that Junei's 1987 'Let's Ride' was inspired by this milestone published five years earlier by Stefano Zito. <br>\nThe sequences of this song, which has become legendary, now sound good, precise and without the distortion of the previous reissues. <br>\nBy turning the vinyl you'll find a later work by Stefano Galante, the same composer and arranger who, along with Claudio Casalini, at the end of the 80s created a song renamed 'Music For All Of Us'. 13 sumptuous minutes completely rebuilt by Danilo Braca. The Italian DJ based in the Big Apple is a true magician in radically transforming a song without losing its original charm. His version, renewed with a more modern and universal taste, will certainly please everyone. Very captivating, it will attract many new young Italo-Disco fans.",

    "description": "Daring techno figure Drumcomplex has been keeping busy, despite the current universal club hiatus. Cooped up in the studio, where no one but his close collaborators could enter, he has concocted his 3th album, consisting of eleven original tracks. It's a release that shows off his well-rounded, calculated style, bearing the typical Drumcomplex imprint, while incorporating more recent influences. Long time friend and melodic techno aficionado Frank Sonic makes two appearances, first one on the intro track, a more melancholic starter to an otherwise upbeat slew of tracks. Later on, as we're taken through intricate yet straightforward cuts like Universe and The Heat, he makes his mark on Deeply Anchored, an ethereal vocal-centered dreamy pad-heavy journey. We also encounter a collaboration with Ben Champell, a more heavy-hitting, ready for the floor cut. At over seven minutes, title track The Story Of Now is the LP's epic centrepiece, with subtle hints of breaks and an array of contagious percussion and metallic synths. While all tracks can be defined as techno, the producer's sound design chops are evident, considering the variety of soundscapes we're taken through track by track. A great example is Running Funky, who, albeit using an eponymous vocal loop, demonstrates Drumcomplex' ability to also get very, very groovy. The LP is rounded off however in true Complexed style with club-primed weapons such as Cook or Surrender with Uncertain from Vienna, that spell late night havoc. All in all, an enjoyable release both for at-home listening as well as in-club use, reaching far and wide into the realm of techno with rowdy rave capabilities and intricate melodies",

    "description": "3x12\"<br>\n<br>\nA master in letting shapes find their form, Dixon allows the listener to wallow in recurring scenes. Lost Communication Procedure, Found In Space and Remarkable Wanderer etch a sound world of choral vibrations and cinematic dirge. Where gaseous clouds scrape the natural sonic pastures of such environments, the hypnotized listener staggers a drunken step, moving sideways by 0 or 1 or -1 into new scenes. Not least an expert in industrial abstraction, a human silhouette permeates Dixon’s sound. His ethereal storytelling portrays the heart-rending romance of Unconditional Love and unearths in I’m Away In Detroit monologuing moodscapes recalling our GPS voice assistants. <br>\nOut of Darkness initial recalls Kraftwerk’s Geiger counter, as from pure signal data and feedback spells an unceasing locomotive wormhole. Hazy, dense grooves drive across bleak city scenes in We Can Rebuild Him, into the raw vibe of Framework and the rude stabs of Spectrum of Light. The varying presence of Dixon's work is one of his textural signatures, at arm's length, brushing right within, and far out. The bumping mood of Earth Station is one such moment, close enough to isolate the diving bass somewhere within, simultaneously from afar it becomes positively gravitational. <br>\nThe first two records of the series are rightfully considered among the finest embodiments of contemporary minimalism, symbolic documents of afro-futurism. This new work revives the classic series, continuing the relationship between Tresor and the undisputed master of Detroit techno into the present day.",

    "description": "After offering tantalising clues to a new release in recent months, KONTENT finally reveals the author behind its third outing. Following on from his highly applauded release on Italian label Hashplant, Romanian mysterio Leanca now takes centre stage on KNTNT003 with three infectious minimal grooves. Kickstarting with the thunderous low end roll of ‘Zboina Zare’, Leanca sends us on a raucously musical journey. Making us jack with a knee weakening, sub bass wobble on ‘Rockability’ and tweaking our metal state with the immersive soundscape of ‘Umbra Mareliu Falnic’. There’s plenty to enjoy on this magnificent contribution to KONTENT, as Leanca draws us further into his eccentric and infinitely unique musical universe.",

    "description": "After shining a light on the rich history of Eevo Lute with two retrospective compilations of Wladimir M. and Florence earlier in the year, Delsin dives deeper in the Dutch techno archives once more by re-masterering, re-cutting and re-releasing Ballet Mechanique's Embody EP. A keystone release containing four tracks of tough, yet emotive electro jams, sounding fresh till the date of today. Originally released in 1996 on Eevo Lute Muzique and definitely one of the highlights when it comes to pure futuristic techno soul. The Embody EP from Jeroen Borrenbergs aka Ballet Mechanique and Eevo's in-house graphic designer at that time made his first public work on one of the most influential techno labels from the Netherlands.",
